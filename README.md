# Zigbee R22 add-on for nRF Connect SDK

> This is a production ready release of Zigbee R22 support for Nordic Semiconductorâ€™s nRF52833, nRF52840 and nRF5340 SoCs.
> 
> Zigbee R22 is currently in maintenance mode, and it is not recommended to use it for new Zigbee designs. While critical bug fixes and security updates will be provided as necessary, it will not receive any enhancements or new features.
> 
> The [Zigbee R23 add-on](https://github.com/nrfconnect/ncs-zigbee) represents Nordic's primary solution for future Zigbee developments, offering improvements, support for new features, and support for the nRF52840 SoC and new platforms such as the nRF54L series.

The Zigbee R22 add-on for the nRF Connect SDK provides support for developing Zigbee applications based on the third-party precompiled ZBOSS stack. This stack is included as the ZBOSS Zigbee R22 stack library. In combination with the nRF Connect SDK, the Zigbee R22 add-on allows for development of low-power connected solutions.
