You can add support for the nRF21540 front-end module to this sample by using one of the following options, depending on your hardware:

* Build the sample for one board that contains the nRF21540 FEM, such as :`nrf21540dk/nrf52840 <nrf52840dk_>_`.
* Manually create a devicetree overlay file that describes how the nRF21540 FEM is connected to the SoC.
  See `Configuring devicetree`_ for different ways of adding the overlay file.
* Provide nRF21540 FEM capabilities by using a `shield <Shields_>`_, for example the `nRF21540 EK <Developing with the nRF21540 EK_>`_ shield that is available in the |NCS|.
  In this case, build the project for a board connected to the shield you are using with an appropriate variable included in the build command, for example ``-DSHIELD=nrf21540ek``.
  This variable instructs the build system to append the appropriate devicetree overlay file.

  .. tabs::

     .. group-tab:: nRF Connect for VS Code

        To build the sample in the |nRFVSC| for an nRF52840 DK with the nRF21540 EK attached, add the shield variable in the build configuration's :guilabel:`Extra CMake arguments` and rebuild the build configuration.
        For example: ``-DSHIELD=nrf21540ek``.

        See `How to work with build configurations`_ in the |nRFVSC| documentation for more information.

     .. group-tab:: Command line

        To build the sample from the command line for an nRF52840 DK with the nRF21540 EK attached, use the following command within the sample directory:

        .. code-block:: console

           west build -b nrf52840dk/nrf52840 -- -DSHIELD=nrf21540ek

  See `Building and programming with nRF21540 EK`_ in the |NCS| documentation for information about how to program when you are using a board with a network core, for example nRF5340 DK.

Each of these options adds the description of the nRF21540 FEM to the devicetree.
See `Developing with Front-End Modules`_ in the |NCS| documentation for more information about FEM in the |NCS|.

To add support for other front-end modules, add the respective devicetree file entries to the board devicetree file or the devicetree overlay file.
