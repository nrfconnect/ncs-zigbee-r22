**NCSIDB-1336: Zigbee Router device cannot rejoin after missing Network Key update or rotation**

  .. toggle::

    If a Zigbee Router device does not receive a Network Key update or rotation messages (such as because of an ongoing reset or being powered off), it will not rejoin to a Zigbee Coordinator and will use old keys for communication.

    The Zigbee R22 Core Specification, section 4.3.6.1 says that â€œA device that is operating in a network and has missed a network key update may also use these procedures to receive the latest network keyâ€, referring to the procedure to get a new network key.
    Since it uses the word MAY, not SHOULD, it means the ZBOSS stack implementation does not violate the specification.
    In addition, BDB 3.0 does not describe a procedure that can be used by a Zigbee Router device to verify if the security keys it uses are still valid.

    **Workaround:** You can extend a Zigbee Router device application to handle this scenario.
    This is done by handling the ``ZB_NLME_STATUS_INDICATION`` status that contains the ``ZB_NWK_COMMAND_STATUS_BAD_KEY_SEQUENCE_NUMBER`` status.
    It is not advised to proceed with a rejoin immediately after the first ``ZB_NWK_COMMAND_STATUS_BAD_KEY_SEQUENCE_NUMBER``, because this could make the network vulnerable to attackers trying to force a rejoin without knowing the network key.

    The signal handling logic is as follows:

    .. code-block:: c

      void zboss_signal_handler(zb_bufid_t bufid)
      {
              zb_zdo_app_signal_hdr_t *sig_hndler = NULL;
              zb_zdo_app_signal_type_t sig = zb_get_app_signal(bufid, &sig_hndler);

              /* Update network status LED. */
              zigbee_led_status_update(bufid, ZIGBEE_NETWORK_STATE_LED);



              switch (sig) {

      case ZB_NLME_STATUS_INDICATION:
              zb_zdo_signal_nlme_status_indication_params_t *nlme_status_ind = ZB_ZDO_SIGNAL_GET_PARAMS(sig_hndler, zb_zdo_signal_nlme_status_indication_params_t);


      if (nlme_status_ind->nlme_status.status ==  ZB_NWK_COMMAND_STATUS_BAD_KEY_SEQUENCE_NUMBER) {
                                      // optional check connection
                                      // optional rejoin if necessary
      }
      break;

      default:
              /* Call default signal handler. */
              ZB_ERROR_CHECK(zigbee_default_signal_handler(bufid));
              break;

              }
      }

    After receiving several (for example, five) status messages with a bad key sequence number, check if the device is connected to the network, such as by calling the :c:func:`zb_zdo_simple_desc_req` function.
    If the returned message status is not ``ZB_ZDP_STATUS_SUCCESS``, initiate the rejoin procedure by calling the :c:func:`zb_bdb_initiate_tc_rejoin` function.
    The device will switch the key and successfully rejoin network, whether the network is open or closed.

**KRKNWK-14024: Fatal error when the network coordinator factory resets in the Identify mode**

  .. toggle::

    A fatal error occurs when the :ref:`Zigbee network coordinator <zigbee_network_coordinator_sample>` triggers factory reset in the Identify mode.

    **Workaround:** Modify your application, so that the factory reset is requested only after the Identify mode ends.

**KRKNWK-12937: Activation of Sleepy End Device must be done at the very first commissioning procedure for Zigbee light switch sample**

  .. toggle::

    After programming the :ref:`Zigbee light switch <zigbee_light_switch_sample>` sample and its first commissioning, Zigbee End Device joins the Zigbee network as a normal End Device. Pressing **Button 3** does not switch the device to the Sleepy End Device configuration.

    **Workaround:** Keep **Button 3** pressed during the first commissioning procedure.

**KRKNWK-12615: Get Group Membership Command returns all groups the node is assigned to**

  .. toggle::

    Get Group Membership Command returns all groups the node is assigned to regardless of the destination endpoint.

**KRKNWK-12115: Simultaneous commissioning of many devices can cause the Coordinator device to assert**

  .. toggle::

    The Zigbee Coordinator device can assert when multiple devices are being commissioned simultaneously.
    In some cases, the device can end up in the low memory state as the result.

    **Workaround:** To lower the likelihood of the Coordinator device asserting, increase its scheduler queue and buffer pool by completing the following steps:

    1. Create your own custom memory configuration file by creating an empty header file for your application, similar to :file:`include/zb_mem_config_custom.h` header file in the :ref:`Zigbee light switch <zigbee_light_switch_sample>` sample.
    #. Copy the contents of :file:`zb_mem_config_max.h` memory configuration file to the memory configuration header file you have just created.
       The Zigbee Network Coordinator sample uses the contents of the memory configuration file by default.
    #. In your custom memory configuration file, locate the following code:

      .. code-block:: c

          /* Now if you REALLY know what you do, you can study zb_mem_config_common.h and redefine some configuration parameters, like:
          #undef ZB_CONFIG_SCHEDULER_Q_SIZE
          #define ZB_CONFIG_SCHEDULER_Q_SIZE 56
          */

    #. Replace the code you have just located with the following code:

      .. code-block:: c

          /* Increase Scheduler queue size. */
          undef ZB_CONFIG_SCHEDULER_Q_SIZE
          define ZB_CONFIG_SCHEDULER_Q_SIZE XYZ
          /* Increase buffer pool size. */
          undef ZB_CONFIG_IOBUF_POOL_SIZE
          define ZB_CONFIG_IOBUF_POOL_SIZE XYZ

    #. To increase the scheduler queue size, replace ``XYZ`` next to ``ZB_CONFIG_SCHEDULER_Q_SIZE`` with the value of your choice, ranging from ``48U`` to ``256U``.
    #. To increase the buffer pool size, replace ``XYZ`` next to ``ZB_CONFIG_IOBUF_POOL_SIZE`` with the value of your choice, ranging from ``48U`` to ``127U``.

**KRKNWK-12017: Zigbee End Device does not recover from broken rejoin procedure**

  .. toggle::

    If the Device Announcement packet is not acknowledged by the End Device's parent, joiner logic is stopped and the device does not recover.

    **Workaround:** Complete the following steps to detect when the rejoin procedure breaks and reset the device:

    1. Introduce helper variable ``joining_signal_received``.
    #. Extend ``zigbee_default_signal_handler()`` by completing the following steps:

      a. Set ``joining_signal_received`` to ``true`` in the following signals: ``ZB_BDB_SIGNAL_DEVICE_FIRST_START``, ``ZB_BDB_SIGNAL_DEVICE_REBOOT``, ``ZB_BDB_SIGNAL_STEERING``.
      #. If ``leave_type`` is set to ``ZB_NWK_LEAVE_TYPE_REJOIN``, set ``joining_signal_received`` to ``false`` in the ``ZB_ZDO_SIGNAL_LEAVE`` signal.
      #. Handle the ``ZB_NLME_STATUS_INDICATION`` signal to detect when End Device failed to transmit packet to its parent, reported by signal's status ``ZB_NWK_COMMAND_STATUS_PARENT_LINK_FAILURE``.

    See the following snippet for an example:

    .. code-block:: c

      /* Add helper variable that will be used for detecting broken rejoin procedure. */
      /* Flag indicating if joining signal has been received since restart or leave with rejoin. */
      bool joining_signal_received = false;
      /* Extend the zigbee_default_signal_handler() function. */
      case ZB_BDB_SIGNAL_DEVICE_FIRST_START:
          ...
          joining_signal_received = true;
          break;
      case ZB_BDB_SIGNAL_DEVICE_REBOOT:
          ...
          joining_signal_received = true;
          break;
      case ZB_BDB_SIGNAL_STEERING:
          ...
          joining_signal_received = true;
          break;
      case ZB_ZDO_SIGNAL_LEAVE:
          if (status == RET_OK) {
              zb_zdo_signal_leave_params_t *leave_params = ZB_ZDO_SIGNAL_GET_PARAMS(sig_hndler, zb_zdo_signal_leave_params_t);
              LOG_INF("Network left (leave type: %d)", leave_params->leave_type);

              /* Set joining_signal_received to false so broken rejoin procedure can be detected correctly. */
              if (leave_params->leave_type == ZB_NWK_LEAVE_TYPE_REJOIN) {
                  joining_signal_received = false;
              }
          ...
          break;
      case ZB_NLME_STATUS_INDICATION: {
          zb_zdo_signal_nlme_status_indication_params_t *nlme_status_ind =
              ZB_ZDO_SIGNAL_GET_PARAMS(sig_hndler, zb_zdo_signal_nlme_status_indication_params_t);
          if (nlme_status_ind->nlme_status.status == ZB_NWK_COMMAND_STATUS_PARENT_LINK_FAILURE) {

              /* Check for broken rejoin procedure and restart the device to recover. */
              if (stack_initialised && !joining_signal_received) {
                  zb_reset(0);
              }
          }
          break;
      }

**KRKNWK-7723: OTA upgrade process restarting after client reset**

  .. toggle::

    After the reset of OTA Upgrade Client, the client will start the OTA upgrade process from the beginning instead of continuing the previous process.
